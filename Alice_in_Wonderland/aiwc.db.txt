AB  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a disorienting perceptual disorder characterized 
      by discrete episodes of bizarre visual illusions and spatial distortions which
      has been associated with numerous neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Little
      is known regarding the electrophysiologic correlates of the visual symptoms
      described in this syndrome. The authors report the unique case of an 8-year-old
      boy presenting with visual distortions consistent with Alice in Wonderland
      syndrome, and an electroencephalogram demonstrating bilateral temporo-occipital
      slowing which correlated with symptoms of micropsia, teleopsia, and
      dysmorphopsia. Identification of this clinical syndrome and its electroclinical
      features are important for establishing a proper diagnosis and subsequent
      reassurance or appropriate treatment directed toward the underlying etiology.

AB  - Alice in wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare perceptual disorder characterized
      by subjective distortions of visual and somatosensory perception. Symptoms of
      AIWS are attributable to functional and structural changes of the visual and
      somatosensory perceptual system; however, few reports have investigated the
      pathophysiology of AIWS with regard to epilepsy, especially ictal
      electroencephalogram (EEG) changes. Herein, we describe the case of an
      82-year-old woman with focal onset epilepsy presenting with AIWS, whose seizures 
      were documented by video-EEG monitoring. Video-EEG revealed multiple focal
      impaired awareness seizures, and ictal EEG changes arose from the right occipital
      region with small periodic positive discharges with evolution towards the right
      centro-parietal regions. Our case highlights not only a relationship between
      epileptic seizures and AIWS but also provides pathological insight into AIWS.

TI  - Coining the Pablo Picasso Syndrome.
PG  - 626-629
LID - 10.1111/head.13702 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Alice in Wonderland Syndrome has been well described in the
      literature. Along with sensory disturbances, patients notably experience
      metamorphopsias, or distortions in size (micropsia/macropsia) and distance
      (teleopsia), particularly of body parts. Some migraineurs, however, report
      dislocation and disorientation of body parts, which are common features found in 
      paintings of Pablo Picasso. METHODS: A 60-year-old female with a 20-year history 
      of chronic migraine presented for evaluation of frequent headaches and visual
      disturbances. In between her attacks of migraine, she would occasionally notice
      alterations which she describes as a "Picasso" painting. When looking at people, 
      she would note their ear on top of their head, or their right arm would be short 
      and attached to the face. This would occur 1-2 times per week and would last 5 to
      10 minutes. Inanimate objects, however, would not appear distorted. RESULTS: The 
      available literature, including published works and biographies, suggests Picasso
      did not suffer from migraine. Nonetheless, careful descriptions taken from
      migraineurs with visual disturbances may uncover features that resemble his
      paintings, be it dislocation of limbs with hints of cubism, as reported above, or
      illusory splitting as has been previously reported. CONCLUSION: Dislocation or
      disorientation of body parts as a migraine-related visual phenomenon is rare and 
      only sparsely reported in the medical literature. Coining of a "Pablo Picasso
      Syndrome" may better describe this occurrence.

AB  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a paroxysmal, perceptual, visual and
      somesthetic disorder that can be found in patients with migraine, epilepsy,
      cerebrovascular disease or infections. The condition is relatively rare and
      unique in its hallucinatory characteristics. OBJECTIVE To discuss the potential
      pathways involved in AIWS. Interest in this subject arose from a patient seen at 
      our service, in which dysmetropsia of body image was reported by the patient,
      when she saw it in her son. METHODS We reviewed and discussed the medical
      literature on reported patients with AIWS, possible anatomical pathways involved 
      and functional imaging studies. RESULTS A complex neural network including the
      right temporoparietal junction, secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, 
      right posterior insula, and primary and extrastriate visual cortical regions seem
      to be involved in AIWS to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS AIWS is a very complex
      condition that typically has been described as isolated cases or series of cases.

AB  - This case report describes a seven-year-old girl with autism and nightly
      "anxiety" attacks. A diagnosis of Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) presumably 
      associated to migraine was made, and the girl was successfully treated with
      lamotrigine. Effective treatment of the AIWS depends on correct diagnosis.
      Symptoms are bizarre and affect the senses of vision, sensation, touch and
      hearing, as well as one's own body image. AIWS is associated with epilepsy,
      migraine, certain infectious diseases and rarely cerebral tumours.

AB  - The distinction between body image and body schema has been incredibly
      influential in cognitive neuroscience. Recently, researchers have begun to
      speculate about the relationship between these representations (Gadsby, 2017,
      2018; Pitron & de Vignemont, 2017; Pitron et al., 2018). Within this emerging
      literature, Pitron et al. (2018) proposed that the long-term body image and
      long-term body schema co-construct one another, through a process of reciprocal
      interaction. In proposing this model, they make two assumptions: that the
      long-term body image incorporates the spatial characteristics of tools, and that 
      it is distorted in the case of Alice in wonderland syndrome. Here, I challenge
      these assumptions, with a closer examination of what the term "long-term body
      image" refers to. In doing so, I draw out some important taxonomic principles for
      research into body representation.

      Disease.

AB  - Background: Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare neurological disorder
      characterized by distortions of visual perception (metamorphopsias), the body
      image, and the experience of time, along with derealization and
      depersonalization. Some 85% of patients present with perceptual distortions in a 
      single sensory modality, e.g., only visual or only somesthetic in nature.
      Moreover, the majority experience only a single type of distortion, e.g., only
      micropsia or only macropsia. AIWS has many different etiologies, and hence an
      extensive differential diagnosis. Its amenability to treatment depends on the
      underlying pathological process, which in children is mostly encephalitis, and in
      adults, migraine. In the literature, no more than 180 "clinical" cases of AIWS
      have been described (i.e., cases in need of medical attention). Of them, some 50%
      showed a favorable prognosis. However, non-clinical cases (i.e., fleeting,
      transient cases of AIWS for which no professional help is needed) have been
      described in up to 30% of the general population. This indicates that AIWS is
      perhaps not as rare as traditionally assumed, and has led some authors to
      conclude that, prognostically, AIWS is usually harmless. Methods: From our own
      clinical practice, we describe the first known case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease 
      (CJD, Heidenhain variant) that presented with symptoms of AIWS. Results: In our
      patient, disease onset was sudden and rapidly progressive, starting with isolated
      visual symptoms. Symptoms of AIWS comprised akinetopsia, chloropsia, micropsia,
      macropsia, zoom vision, and time distortions (quick-motion phenomenon and
      protracted duration). Soon, these were complicated by paraesthesias, gait
      instability, aphasia, expressive amusia, cognitive decline, and behavioral
      changes in the form of agitation and emotional lability. The diagnosis of
      probable sporadic CJD was confirmed with the aid of a head MRI and cerebrospinal 
      fluid (14-3-3 protein). In the absence of any treatment options, our patient was 
      discharged home and died within 2 months after his visual symptoms had begun.
      Autopsy consent was not obtained. Conclusion: We conclude that AIWS is not always
      as harmless as sometimes suggested, and that CJD, although extremely rare, must
      be part of its extensive differential diagnosis, notably in the presence of rapid
      cognitive decline.

PG  - 1435-1437

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this work, we describe an association of brainstem headache with
      aura (BHA) and Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) in a 17-year-old male,
      suffering from crises of vertigo, weakness, dysarthria, and diplopia, in
      half-hour duration, followed by diffuse or occipital headache, lasting several
      hours. METHODS: The frequency of the attacks was monthly, and once there was
      short loss of consciousness. The last episodes were accompanied by symptoms such 
      as deformation of figures and objects, small or large in shape. RESULTS:
      Diagnostic examinations were performed, mainly neuroimaging tests such as brain
      MRI and brain angio-MRI, all resulting normal; and treatment with flunarizine was
      followed by improvement of both BHA and AIWS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There would
      be a correlation between BHA and AIWS, presumably represented by dysfunction of
      temporo-parieto-occipital carrefour.

TI  - Neuro-Ophthalmic Symptoms of Primary Headache Disorders: Why the Patient With
      Headache May Present to Neuro-Ophthalmology.
PG  - 200-207
LID - 10.1097/WNO.0000000000000790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary headache disorders can cause many ophthalmic symptoms that
      lead many patients to present for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation.
      Neuro-ophthalmologists frequently encounter these patients in clinical practice. 
      EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature review was completed in PubMed using the
      following terms paired with "migraine" and "headache:" dry eye, eye pain,
      monocular diplopia, binocular diplopia, photophobia, visual field defect, tunnel 
      vision, floaters, amaurosis fugax, transient visual obscuration, autonomic
      symptoms, anisocoria, visual snow, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, and palinopsia. 
      RESULTS: Patients with migraine experience a wide range of visual disturbances
      including aura and more complex perceptual abnormalities such as Alice in
      Wonderland syndrome and visual snow. Visual disturbances may consist of positive 
      and/or negative phenomena and may be binocular or monocular. Migraine and other
      primary headache disorders can be associated with photophobia, eye pain, dry eye,
      autonomic features, and anisocoria. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with primary headache
      disorders may experience a wide range of visual and ophthalmic symptoms. An
      understanding of the typical features of these disorders allows providers to help
      patients find appropriate treatment without unnecessary testing and to recognize 
      when atypical presentations require additional evaluation.

TI  - Atypical Symptoms in Migraine-Related Alice in Wonderland Syndrome: Expansion of 
      the Phenotype and Reflection on the Pathomechanism.
PG  - 163-165
AB  - We report an 8-year-old girl who experienced daily episodes of visual and
      somesthetic distortion and was diagnosed with Alice in wonderland syndrome
      (AIWS). Ophthalmologic assessment revealed best-corrected visual acuity of 0.2 in
      both eyes, and bilateral constricted tubular or spiral visual fields. Augmented
      amplitude of visually evoked potentials was revealed, and treatment with
      lomerizine and valproate showed favorable effect on the visual/somesthetic
      distortion as well as the visual field and acuity. Psychogenic visual problems
      can co-exist with the typical sensory distortion in AIWS, similarly to the case
      of psychogenic pseudo-seizures in subjects with epilepsy. Otherwise, an ambiguous
      borderline between psychological and physical pathomechanisms in migraine may
      also be characteristic of the migraine-related AIWS.

AB  - Most patients with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis initially
      present with psychiatric symptoms. Although a delayed diagnosis may lead to a
      poor outcome, psychiatric symptoms that could differentiate anti-NMDAR
      encephalitis from other psychoses have not been fully investigated. We evaluated 
      two patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who were observed by psychiatrists from
      onset throughout the course of disease. Both patients exhibited disorientation,
      memory deficits, perceptual disturbances, hallucinations, and mood liability.
      Among those, altered perceptions were most prominent - in particular, altered
      time perceptions without disorganization syndrome. The information obtained for
      these patients may help clinicians differentiate anti-NMDAR encephalitis from
      other psychoses, e.g., schizophrenia.

AB  - Migraine with aura in children is often reported, typical aura without headache
      is reported sometimes, but persistent aura and Alice in Wonderland syndrome is
      exceptionally reported. We present a case corresponding to the last one mentioned
      in a 6-year-old patient who had at least two episodes with the typical
      characteristics of aura without migraine before developing more frequently the
      complete clinical picture of aura and subsequently headache. The complementary
      studies systematically done to the patient were normal and she improved with
      conventional therapy.It is important to emphasize that the syndrome should be
      suspected in any patient who presents the described manifestations in order to
      approach to the diagnosis of aura without migraine, to discard either organic
      pathology or another cause and to indicate adequate therapeutic measures.

AB  - Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is a rare perceptual disorder characterized
      by an erroneous perception of the body or the surrounding space. AIWS may be
      caused by different pathologies, ranging from infections to migraine. We present 
      the case of a 54-year-old man, with a long-time history of migraine without aura,
      diagnosed with AIWS due to a glioblastoma located in the left temporal-occipital 
      junction. To date, this is the first case of AIWS caused by glioblastoma. This
      case suggests that to exclude aura-mimic phenomena, a careful diagnostic workup
      should always be performed even in patients with a long-time history of migraine.

AB  - Background: Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare sensory perception
      disorder, most often caused by migraine in adults. We aimed to characterize the
      clinical characteristics of AIWS in a cohort of vestibular migraine (VM)
      patients. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with VM seen 
      between August 2014 and January 2018. Results: Seventeen patients were identified
      (10 women) with a median age at onset of 45 years (range 15-61 years), and median
      age at presentation of 49 years (range 17-63 years). Eighty-two percent reported 
      1 AIWS symptom, 12% reported 3 symptoms, and 6% described 2 symptoms. The most
      common symptom was visual distortions (47%), followed by extrapersonal
      misperceptions (41%) and somesthetic distortions (29%). Most AIWS occurred during
      VM episodes (77%). Eleven patients were seen in follow-up; 10 described complete 
      or partial resolution of both AIWS and VM with migraine preventive therapy, while
      1 experienced complete resolution of VM but continued to have AIWS.
      Neuro-otologic abnormalities improved in 2 patients. Conclusions: This study
      characterizes the clinical features of AIWS in patients with VM. We observed
      several rare and highly unusual AIWS misperceptions (frosted-glass vision,
      underwater vision, dolly zoom effect, sensation of the brain coming out of the
      head, closed-eye visual hallucinations, and headlight glare-induced
      marco/microsomatognosia), and resolution or improvement in AIWS and VM with
      migraine preventive treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Visual misperceptions as a result of neurosurgical disorders are well
      documented. Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AWS) typically is reported in
      neurologic and psychiatric disorders. We present a patient who developed symptoms
      of AWS postoperatively. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old man presented in shunt
      failure, attributed to a proximal catheter occlusion. Operative revision with
      replacement of the proximal catheter was performed without incident.
      Postoperatively, he complained of visual disturbances, including the perception
      that people had small heads on full-sized bodies. Symptoms resolved
      postoperatively. The patient's symptoms were diagnosed as a transient episode of 
      AWS. This was attributed to manipulation of the parieto-occipital cortex during
      the revision. The local inflammatory response from manipulation of that area is
      thought to have caused our patient's symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Visual disturbances
      caused by lesions along the optic radiations are common findings for neurosurgery
      patients, although AWS after surgical intervention has not been reported
      previously.

AB  - Despite their differences, body schema and the body image representations are not
      only consistent in everyday life, but also sometimes consistent in pathological
      disorders, such as in Alice in Wonderland syndrome and anorexia nervosa. The
      challenge is to understand how they achieve such consistency. Recently, we
      suggested that these two representations were co-constructed (Pitron & Vignemont,
      2017). In his reply, Gadsby (2018) invited us to clarify how this co-construction
      works and to what extent the body schema and the body image can reshape each
      other. Here we motivate conceptual grounds for a model on which these two forms
      of representation modify one another and explore theoretical options for the
      way(s) in which they might do so. In particular, we highlight the virtues of a
      serial model in which the body schema has some primacy over the body image, while
      also acknowledging the special role played by the body image.

      infection.
PG  - 660-663
LID - 10.1007/s13365-018-0645-1 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus endemic in Africa and Southern Asian countries,
      which has recently emerged in unprecedented epidemic proportions around the
      world. Although ZIKV infection is often asymptomatic or distinguished by
      non-specific influenza-like symptoms, an increase in its pathogenicity and
      biological behavior has been the hallmark of the current pandemic. Increasing
      evidence suggests that neurotropic strains of ZIKV have evolved from less
      pathogenic strains of the virus. Neurological manifestations of ZIKV infection
      include a spectrum of congenital and non-congenital clinical entities, however
      visual somatosensory perceptual disorders have not been recorded to date. Herein,
      we report a case of a 15-year-old female who presented with a constellation of
      perceptual symptoms (metamorphopsia, telopsia, and pelopsia) following acute ZIKV
      infection. Although such symptoms may have originated from direct viral injury, a
      post-ZIKV autoimmune reaction to previously unexposed neuronal surface antigens
      or through molecular mimicry cannot be excluded. The development of Alice in
      Wonderland syndrome in our patient highlights the ever-increasing expanding
      spectrum of neurological symptoms associated to ZIKV infection.

TI  - Evidence for the Perception of Time Distortion During Episodes of Alice in
      Wonderland Syndrome.
PG  - 473-475
LID - 10.1097/NMD.0000000000000825 [doi]
AB  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare perceptual disorder associated with
      sensation of one or several visual and/or auditory perceptual distortions
      including size of body parts, size of external objects, or passage of time
      (either speeding up or slowing down). Cause for AIWS is yet to be widely agreed, 
      and the implications are widely varied. One of the research difficulties is the
      brevity of each episode, typically not exceeding few tens of minutes. This
      article presents a male adult in late 20s who has apparently experienced AIWS
      episodes since childhood, and infection has been ruled out. Reaction speed tests 
      were conducted during and after AIWS episodes, across a span of 13 months.
      Statistically significant evidence is present for delayed response time during
      AIWS episodes when the patient claims to experience a sensation of time
      distortion: where events seem to move faster and people appear to speak quicker.

AB  - In their article, Pitron and de Vignemont (2017) provide an insightful and well
      overdue discussion of the relationship between long-term body representation
      models and Alice in Wonderland syndrome. Here, I supplement their discussion with
      a number of observations. First, I present a cautionary note regarding the
      interpretation of experiential changes in body size as reflective of changes in
      the content of body representations. Second, I show how their evidence
      contradicts an alternative model of body representation arising from research
      into anorexia nervosa-the "LTB" hypothesis. Finally, I highlight a significant
      issue with their proposed co-construction model.

TI  - Primary care challenges of an obscure case of "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome in a
      patient with severe malaria in a resource-constrained setting: a case report.
PG  - 789
LID - 10.1186/s12879-017-2918-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome (AIWS) is a rare neurological
      abnormality characterized by distortions of visual perceptions, body schema and
      experience of time. AIWS has been reported in patients with various infections
      such as infectious mononucleosis, H1N1 influenza, Cytomegalovirus encephalitis,
      and typhoid encephalopathy. However, AIWS occurring in a patient with severe
      malaria is less familiar and could pose serious primary care challenges in a
      low-income context. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old male of black African
      ethnicity was brought by his parents to our primary care hospital because for 2
      days he had been experiencing intermittent sudden perceptions of his parents'
      heads and objects around him either "shrinking" or "expanding". The visual
      perceptions were usually brief and resolved spontaneously. One week prior to the 
      onset of the visual problem, he had developed an intermittent high grade fever
      that was associated with other severe constitutional symptoms. Based on the
      historical and clinical data that were acquired, severe malaria was suspected and
      this was confirmed by hyperparasitaemia on blood film analysis. The patient was
      treated with quinine for 10 days. Apart from a single episode of generalized
      tonic-clonic seizures that was observed on the first day of treatment, the
      overall clinical progress was good. The visual illusions completely resolved and 
      no further abnormalities were recorded during 3 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: 
      Symptoms of AIWS usually resolve spontaneously or after treatment of an
      underlying cause. In our case, the successful treatment of severe malaria
      coincided with a complete regression of AIWS whose aetiology was
      poorly-elucidated given the resource constraints. In any case, the good outcome
      of our patient aligns with previous reports on acute AIWS that highlight a
      limited need for excessive investigation and treatment modalities which are, in
      passing, predominantly unaffordable in resource-limited primary care settings.

TI  - The Alice-in-Wonderland Syndrome.
PG  - 142-150
LID - 10.1159/000475722 [doi]
AB  - In 1955, English psychiatrist John Todd defined the Alice-in-Wonderland syndrome 
      (AIWS) as self-experienced paroxysmal body-image illusions involving distortions 
      of the size, mass, or shape of the patient's own body or its position in space,
      often accompanied by depersonalization and/or derealization. AIWS had been
      described by American Neurologist Caro Lippman in 1952, but Todd's report was the
      most influential. Todd named the syndrome for the perceptual disorder of altered 
      body image experienced by the protagonist in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
      (1865) by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson). In Carroll's original story, 
      Alice experienced several dramatic changes in body size and shape (e.g.,
      shrinking to 10 inches high, growing unnaturally tall but not any wider, and
      growing unnaturally large). Todd reported 6 cases of AIWS, all of whom had
      episodic body-image distortions like those experienced by Lewis Carroll's Alice
      character; some also had visual perceptual disturbances, but none had visual
      perceptual disorders without body-image distortions. Therefore, AIWS may be
      accompanied by visual perceptual disorders (e.g., micropsia, macropsia, telopsia,
      pelopsia), but basing the diagnosis of AIWS on isolated visual perceptual
      disorders, as has subsequently been done by a number of authors, is inaccurate
      and misleading. Cases of isolated visual illusions without self-perceived
      distortions of body size, shape, or form, do not meet Todd's original criteria,
      nor are they commensurate with the experiences of the protagonist in Alice's
      Adventures in Wonderland. Furthermore, such cases differ by age and etiology from
      those that involve somesthetic perceptual disorders. Therefore, the use of the
      term AIWS for isolated visual illusions is problematic and should be discouraged.
      Although Todd's and Lippman's cases were adolescents or adults, AIWS is most
      commonly reported in children. Reported causes include infection (especially with
      Epstein Barr virus), migraine, epilepsy, depression, and toxic and febrile
      delirium.

AB  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a disorienting neurological condition that
      affects human perception to the senses of vision, hearing, touch, sensation, and 
      the phenomenon of time. Individuals affected with Alice in Wonderland syndrome
      can experience alterations in their perception of the size of objects or their
      own body parts, known as metamorphopsias. It is known to occur in conditions
      including migraine, epilepsy, and certain intoxicants and infectious diseases.
      The name refers to Lewis Carrol's well-known children's book Alice's Adventures
      in Wonderland, in which the title character experiences alterations of sensation 
      in which she felt that her body had grown too tall or too small, or parts of her 
      body were changing shape, size, or relationship to the rest of her body. The
      syndrome was described in 1952 by Caro Lippman, and given its name in 1955 by
      John Todd. The metamorphopsias characteristic of this condition are also
      sometimes referred to as Lilliputian hallucinations, a reference to the fictional
      island of Lilliput in the novel Gulliver's Travels, written by Jonathan Swift in 
      1726. As such, many literary and medical publications have roots in the
      description of this syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the
      literary and historical significance of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, as well as 
      to provide the reader with a medical overview of the condition.

AB  - The distinction between the body schema and the body image has become the stock
      in trade of much recent work in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy. Yet little
      is known about the interactions between these two types of body representations. 
      We need to account not only for their dissociations in rare cases, but also for
      their convergence most of the time. Indeed in our everyday life the body we
      perceive does not conflict with the body we act with. Are the body image and the 
      body schema then somehow reshaping each other or are they relatively independent 
      and do they only happen to be congruent? On the basis of the study of bodily
      hallucinations, we consider which model can best account for the body schema/body
      image interactions.

AB  - Facial perception relies on both configural processing and analytical processing.
      Seventeen years ago, Haxby and colleagues proposed an influential neural model in
      which a core system and an extended system were involved in facial processing.
      Herein, first analyze configural processing on the basis of the Haxby model. We
      review previous findings from published electrophysiological and neuroimaging
      studies, and describe previously reported clinical cases, and finally we discuss 
      our own clinical cases an findings. Based on this work we have sketched out a new
      framework for facial perception suggesting that suggests that the extended system
      includes more widely distributed regions than originally expected.

TI  - A case of recurrent depressive disorder presenting with Alice in Wonderland
      syndrome: psychopathology and pre- and post-treatment FDG-PET findings.
PG  - 150
LID - 10.1186/s12888-017-1314-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare neuropsychiatric
      syndrome that typically manifests in distortion of extrapersonal visual image,
      altered perception of one's body image, and a disturbed sense of the passage of
      distance and time. Several conditions have been reported to contribute to AIWS,
      although its biological basis is still unknown. Here, we present the first case
      demonstrating a clear concurrence of recurrent depressive disorder and AIWS. The 
      clinical manifestations and pre- and post-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose
      positron-emission tomographic (FDG-PET) images provide insights into the
      psychopathological and biological basis of AIWS. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a
      63-year-old Japanese male who developed two distinct episodes of major depression
      concurrent with AIWS. In addition to typical AIWS perceptual symptoms, he
      complained of losing the ability to intuitively grasp the seriousness of news and
      the value of money, which implies disturbance of high-order cognition related to 
      estimating magnitude and worth. Both depression and AIWS remitted after treatment
      in each episode. Pre-treatment FDG-PET images showed significant hypometabolism
      in the frontal cortex and hypermetabolism in the occipital and parietal cortex.
      Post-treatment images showed improvement of these abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The
      clinical co-occurrence of depressive episodes and presentation of AIWS can be
      interpreted to mean that they have certain functional disturbances in common. In 
      view of incapacity, indifference, devitalization, altered perception of one's
      body image, and disturbed sense of time and space, the features of AIWS analogous
      to those of psychotic depression imply a common psychopathological basis. These
      high-order brain dysfunctions are possibly associated with the metabolic
      abnormalities in visual and parietotemporal association cortices that we observed
      on the pre- and post-treatment FDG-PET images in this case, while the
      hypometabolism in the frontal cortex is probably associated with depressive
      symptoms.

AB  - Alice in Wonderland Syndrome was originally coined by Dr. John Todd in 1955. The 
      syndrome is named after the sensations experienced by the character Alice in
      Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Alice in Wonderland
      Syndrome consists of metamorphopsia (seeing something in a distorted fashion),
      bizarre distortions of their body image, and bizarre perceptual distortions of
      form, size, movement or color. Additionally, patients with Alice in Wonderland
      Syndrome can experience auditory hallucinations and changes in their perception
      of time. Currently, there is no known specific cause of Alice in Wonderland
      Syndrome. However, theories point to infections such as the Epstein-Barr virus,
      medications such as topiramate and associated migraines. Neuroimaging studies
      have revealed brain regions involved with the manifestation of symptoms. These
      include the temporo-parietal junction within the temporal lobe and the visual
      pathway, specifically the occipital lobe. There are no current treatments for
      Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Further research is needed to find better
      treatments for Alice in Wonderland Syndrome and to elucidate the exact cause or
      causes of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome.

AB  - Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is a perceptual disorder, principally
      involving visual and somesthetic integration, firstly reported by Todd, on the
      literary suggestion of the strange experiences described by Lewis Carroll in
      Alice in Wonderland books. Symptoms may comprise among others aschematia and
      dysmetropsia. This syndrome has many different etiologies; however EBV infection 
      is the most common cause in children, while migraine affects more commonly
      adults. Many data support a strict relationship between migraine and AIWS, which 
      could be considered in many patients as an aura or a migraine equivalent,
      particularly in children. Nevertheless, AIWS seems to have anatomical correlates.
      According to neuroimaging, temporoparietal-occipital carrefour (TPO-C) is a key
      region for developing many of AIWS symptoms. The final part of this review aims
      to find the relationship between AIWS symptoms, presenting a pathophysiological
      model. In brief, AIWS symptoms depend on an alteration of TPO-C where
      visual-spatial and somatosensory information are integrated. Alterations in these
      brain regions may cause the cooccurrence of dysmetropsia and disorders of body
      schema. In our opinion, the association of other symptoms reported in literature 
      could vary depending on different etiologies and the lack of clear diagnostic
      criteria.

AB  - Robert Bartlett, emeritus Professor of surgery at the University of Michigan in
      Ann Arbor, USA, transformed classical works of world literature (Charles Dickens:
      A Christmas Carol, Lewis Carroll: Alice in Wonderland) into teaching aids for
      advanced training in intensive care medicine. He recently turned his hand to the 
      well-known work of Ernest Hemingway: the Nobel Prize winning novel The Old Man
      and the Sea. Subsequent to Robert Bartlett's essay this article provides
      background information and comments on the current problems in modern intensive
      care medicine addressed in his essay.

TI  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome associated with mycoplasma infection.
PG  - 1057-1059

AB  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare condition in which patients report 
      distorted size perception of objects and their own bodies. Although specific
      causes and pathology have not been elucidated, an association between AIWS and
      infection has been suggested. To our knowledge, mycoplasma-induced AIWS has not
      been examined. A girl aged 7 years 11 months presented with fever (temperature,
      40 degrees C) and cough. Although the fever disappeared after approximately 10
      days, she complained that her mother's face suddenly appeared smaller to her.
      Subsequently, she complained that objects intermittently appeared smaller than
      normal. Particle agglutination test indicated elevated serum antibodies against
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The patient was therefore diagnosed the patient with AIWS 
      secondary to mycoplasma infection. Although mycoplasma infection is known to
      cause various central nervous system symptoms, this is the first report involving
      AIWS, suggesting that mycoplasma could affect visual function in children.

TI  - The Alice in Worderland Syndrome.
PG  - 189-198
LID - 10.1080/09602011.2016.1224191 [doi]
AB  - The Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AWS) was first described more than 60 years ago
      by Lippman. It refers to episodes during which an individual may variously
      experience (as did Alice during her time in Wonderland) somatic, visuo-perceptual
      and/or visuo-spatial hallucinations, as well as feelings of depersonalisation,
      derealisation and distorted sense of time. Although the prevalence of AWS is
      unknown, indirect evidence from both retrospective and prospective studies
      suggests that it is a rare disorder. This paper describes the case of Zoe, a
      right-handed, native English speaker who was age 45 years when she experienced an
      episode of AWS. On neuropsychological assessment, Zoe demonstrated notable
      impairment of attention, learning and recall (particularly for visuo-spatial
      information) as well as executive dysfunction (viz., impairment of planning,
      cognitive flexibility and abstraction), consistent with fronto-temporal
      dysfunction. Detailed profiles of neuropsychological impairment in the context of
      AWS have not previously been reported, and it is unclear if such impairment is,
      indeed, a central and characteristic feature of AWS.

TI  - [Visual Snow Syndrome: Symptoms and Ophthalmological Findings].
PG  - 713-718
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-109701 [doi]
AB  - Background The symptom "visual snow" describes the continuous perception of tiny 
      flickering dots within the whole visual field of both eyes. The diagnosis of a
      visual snow syndrome requires the appearance of typical additional visual
      symptoms and the exclusion of ophthalmological or neurological causes, or
      pharmacological influences. Patients and Methods Three male and four female
      subjects between 13 and 36 years of age referred with visual snow were
      investigated and asked about their symptoms. A complete ophthalmological
      investigation, including binocular fundoscopy, was performed in all patients.
      Furthermore, best corrected visual acuity, perimetry, binocular functions, colour
      vision (D15-test), full-field ERG, pattern-reversal VEP and SD-OCT images of
      macula and optic nerve (RNFL) were analysed. Results Visual acuity of at least
      1.0 and normal findings for all further investigations were observed in all
      patients. The following additional visual symptoms were identified: illusionary
      palinopsia (n = 6), disturbance of night vision (n = 5), positive light phenomena
      (n = 7). A history of migraine with aura was reported in five patients. The
      intake of hallucinogenic drugs or centrally active pharmaceuticals was denied by 
      all patients. The findings of available or initiated neurological investigations 
      were normal. Conclusions The visual snow syndrome has to be regarded as a
      diagnosis of exclusion. Visual function parameters are not impaired. Apart from
      eye diseases, a persistent migraine aura as well as neurological diseases or the 
      intake of hallucinogenic drugs must be excluded as possible causes of visual snow
      and palinopsia.

TI  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome: A systematic review.
PG  - 259-270
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the literature on Alice in Wonderland syndrome
      (AIWS), a disorder characterized by distortions of visual perception, the body
      schema, and the experience of time. RECENT FINDINGS: On the basis of 169
      published case descriptions, the etiology of AIWS is divided into 8 main groups, 
      with neurologic disorders affecting mostly adults and elderly patients and
      encephalitides affecting mostly patients aged </=18 years. Symptoms of AIWS are
      also experienced in the general population, with up to 30% of adolescents
      reporting nonclinical symptoms. SUMMARY: In clinical cases of AIWS, auxiliary
      investigations (including blood tests, EEG, and brain MRI) are strongly advised. 
      Treatment should be directed at the suspected underlying condition, although
      reassurance that the symptoms themselves are not harmful seems to suffice in
      about 50% of the cases. International classifications such as the DSM and ICD
      should consider placing the syndrome on their research agenda.

AB  - This review article summarizes neuropsychological descriptions of abnormal body
      representations in brain-damaged patients and recent neuroscientific
      investigations of their sensorimotor underpinnings in healthy participants. The
      first part of the article describes unilateral disorders of the bodily self, such
      as asomatognosia, feelings of amputation, supernumerary phantom limbs and
      somatoparaphrenia, as well as descriptions of non-lateralized disorders of the
      bodily self, including Alice in Wonderland syndrome and autoscopic
      hallucinations. Because the sensorimotor mechanisms of these disorders are
      unclear, we focus on clinical descriptions and insist on the importance of
      reporting clinical cases to better understand the full range of bodily disorders 
      encountered in neurological diseases. The second part of the article presents the
      advantages of merging neuroscientific approaches of the bodily self with
      immersive virtual reality, robotics and neuroprosthetics to foster the
      understanding of the multisensory, motor and neural mechanisms of bodily
      representations.

TI  - [The Alice in Wonderland syndrome. What do we know after 60 years?].
PG  - 281-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) was conceptualised in 1955 as
      a group of distortions of visual perception, the body schema and the experience
      of time. Although 60 years have passed since then, very little is known yet about
      the syndrome. This is surprising since the AIWS has important diagnostic and
      therapeutic implications. AIM: To provide an overview of the literature on the
      AIWS. METHOD: For this review, a literature search was carried out in PubMed and 
      the historical literature. RESULTS: The search yielded 70 papers with a total of 
      169 case descriptions. As these papers indicate, the AIWS has many causes, the
      main ones being neurological, infectious and substance-related; sometimes the
      causes are psychiatric. Among adults and elderly patients the disorders described
      are mainly neurological; among young people encephalitis is fairly common.
      Treatment needs to be directed at the (assumed) underlying condition, although in
      almost half of the cases the patient's main requirement is reassurance rather
      than treatment. Prevalence rates are unknown, but studies in the general
      population indicate that the symptoms of the AIWS occur more frequently than
      previously assumed. CONCLUSION: Clinical suspicion of an AIWS warrants careful
      auxiliary investigations and - whenever necessary - treatment. The AIWS should
      not be confused with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other perceptual
      disorders, and it deserves to be included in the research agenda of international
      classifications such as the DSM and ICD.

AB  - Migraines are a common paroxysmal disorder that may present with a multitude of
      neurologic symptoms. Migraines have been re-categorized in the most recent
      edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. In this
      article, we review the literature on hemiplegic migraines, alternating hemiplegia
      of childhood, migraine with brainstem aura, retinal migraine, ophthalmoplegic
      migraine, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, and acute confusional migraine. We also
      discuss the principal clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and treatment
      options for these disorders.

AB  - Migraine is a condition that is common in the pediatric and adolescent
      population. Among children with migraine, visual aura can consist of either
      negative or positive features or both. Reports of sensory auras can also be
      elicited with a careful history. The understanding of the types of aura, as well 
      as their relation to the more typical features of migraine, are discussed. The
      similar phenomena of visual snow and Alice in Wonderland syndrome in children are
      also described in detail.

AB  - PURPOSE: To provide an overview of the clinical course for children and
      adolescents with migraine variants (M.V.), childhood periodic syndromes or the
      episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine using the International
      Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition Beta version [ICHD-3]
      International Headache Society criteria for the diagnosis of each disorder.
      METHOD: Migraine is a complex set of neurological symptoms. This review
      encompasses the subtypes of M.V. or episodic syndromes that may be associated
      with migraine within the children and adolescent population. CONCLUSION: The
      episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine or migraine variant is
      multilayered neurological disorder in young children and adolescents. Within the 
      these generally pediatric syndromes there are associated disorders described in
      this review, to provide a clinical overview and including the less common forms
      of migraine, such as acute confusional migraine, trauma-triggered migraine, and
      transient global amnesia.

PG  - 1233-48
LID - 10.1111/head.12688 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unusual headache syndromes are not as infrequent in clinical practice
      as was generally believed. About three fourths of the classified headache
      disorders found in the ICHD-II can be considered rare. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
      narrative review was to perform a literature review of the pathophysiology,
      clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of the following
      unusual headache disorders: Alice in Wonderland syndrome, burning mouth syndrome,
      cold stimulus headache, and the syndrome of transient headache and neurologic
      deficits with cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis. METHOD: A literature review was 
      performed using PubMed for each of the abovementioned headache disorders.
      CONCLUSION: The unusual headache syndromes as a distinct group of disorders are
      not as infrequent in clinical practice as was generally believed. Some of them,
      albeit considered as unusual, may occur with relative frequency, such as cold
      stimulus headache and burning mouth syndrome.

PG  - 320-2

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache which has highly specific
      and sensitive criteria, and notpresence of an aura. It has been recently reported
      that CH may not presence with aura more than ever and this condition will be
      identified by headache specialists as a new form of CH. CASE REPORT: As there is 
      no report to our knowledge on Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) manifested as
      CH aura in the literature, we present a case of a 35-year-old man having AIWS as 
      CH aura. CONCLUSION: Clinically, AIWS is not uncommon and is likely to be
      underestimated as a diagnostic entity. Valproate may be preferred for treatment
      in CH patients with AIWS aura.

TI  - [Phenomenological and Diagnostic Implications of Paraschemazia: A Case Report].
PG  - 138-41
AB  - Paraschemazia is characterized by distortions of body image, and has been
      observed in neurological disorders (epilepsies, migraine, and non-dominant
      cortical lesions), retinal damage, and hallucinogenic drug use. This complex
      symptom cluster of subjective and objective perceptual abnormalities forms an
      essential feature of Todd's Alice in Wonderland syndrome. This neuropsychiatric
      manifestation must be phenomenologically differentiated from hallucinations,
      illusions, and agnosias. Herein we report a patient with paraschemazia that
      occurred during the ictal phase of temporal lobe epilepsy; the patient was
      referred to the department of psychiatry due to symptoms of transient intense
      fear and abnormal perceptions. We also discuss the diagnostic difficulty and
      phenomenological implications associated with this rare phenomenon. A 45-year-old
      female presented with brief episodes (30-45 s) of sensory distortion, during
      which the faces and limbs of other people and her own appeared distorted (e.g.
      protruding eyes, elongated nose, and oval or square head). The episodes of
      sensory distortion were associated with intense fear and were followed by loss of
      consciousness for 5 min. She had been experiencing these episodes since the age
      of 12 years and responded poorly to several antiepileptic medications. 3-Tesla
      MRI performed using a complex partial seizure protocol showed altered signal
      intensity and volume loss in the right hippocampus, suggestive of right mesial
      temporal sclerosis. Neuropsychological assessment showed impaired sustained
      attention, working memory, and verbal and visual learning and memory, suggestive 
      of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal lobe deficits. She improved in 
      response to a combination of levetiracetam and clobazam, and was seizure free at 
      the 2-year follow-up.

TI  - LSD-associated "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome"(AIWS): A Hallucinogen Persisting
      Perception Disorder (HPPD) Case Report.
PG  - 67-8
AB  - A side effect associated with the use of LSD is the return of perceptual
      disturbances which anteriorly emerged during intoxication, despite absence of
      present use. Here we present the case of a patient with a previous history of
      sporadic and recreational cannabis, alcohol and LSD consumption who reported LSD 
      associated "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome" (AIWS) or Todd's syndrome. AIWS is
      basically characterized by four frequent visual illusions: macropsia, micropsia, 
      pelopsia and teleopsia. AIWS only appeared during LSD consumption and continued
      after LSD suspension, namely, Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD).
      This phenomenon did not cause a major functional impairment but provoked
      sufficient worry and concern due to its persistent continuation. The patient
      refused medical treatment and continued psychiatric follow-up. At the one year
      follow-up he reported complete remission. To the best of our knowledge this is
      the first reported case of AIWS which persist after LSD interruption (HPPD) in
      the professional literature. Reasons for this intriguing, benign, reversible and 
      apparently harmless side effect are proposed.

AB  - Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is characterized by a rare constellation of
      perceptual disturbances including distorted body image, metamorphopsia, and
      visual hallucinations. In this report, we relate a unique case of AIWS in a woman
      with a right temporo-parietal cavernoma. AIWS in this patient may be secondary to
      epileptiform activity associated with the cavernoma and improved with
      anti-epileptic treatment.

AB  - There are a wide variety of paroxysmal nonepileptic events (PNEEs) in children
      that can mimic seizures. The type of PNEEs that need to be considered in the
      differential diagnosis depends on the age of symptom onset and the clinical
      features. In infants and toddlers, conditions that are relatively common in
      clinical practice such as apnea, jitteriness, shuddering attacks, and
      breath-holding spells may not present much of a diagnostic conundrum, whereas
      unusual conditions such as hyperekplexia may cause concern. Similarly, although
      most types of migraine are easily distinguished from seizures in school-aged
      children, certain variants such as the "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome or basilar 
      migraine can create diagnostic confusion. Most types of PNEE are exclusive to
      childhood; therefore, the pediatrician must be familiar with a variety of
      physiological processes and pathological entities that can raise concern in
      parents. The pediatrician is in the unique position of being able to reassure
      families and/or guide further work-up. Many of the PNEEs in young children
      require no treatment and resolve spontaneously. It is important to distinguish
      these episodes from true seizures as to avoid unnecessary testing and
      pharmacological treatment. This review highlights common PNEEs in children,
      beginning with the neonatal age group and moving upward to adolescence.

AB  - DESIGN: A prospective observational study over 1 year. SETTING: A District
      General Hospital, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Department. PATIENTS:
      Children aged 8-18 years living in the catchment area of a district hospital
      service with any type of unexplained hallucinations or illusions associated with 
      or without an established diagnosis of migraine. RESULTS: The study identified
      nine children with a combination of migraine and a variety of hallucinations and 
      illusions, including illusions of size, time, colour, body shape, movement and
      visual and auditory hallucination. An average of 10 symptoms (range 7-15) were
      reported. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: None. CONCLUSIONS: It is
      important to recognise these symptoms to enable appropriate history taking and
      diagnosis. These symptoms are common and currently seem to go unrecognised and
      may pose diagnostic difficulties if onset is before typical migraine headaches
      occur.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the distribution of symptoms and etiologies of
      patients with "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome (visual perception of change in
      one's body size) and "Alice in Wonderland"-like syndrome (extrapersonal
      illusions) at presentation and to determine their prognosis. DESIGN:
      Retrospective chart review and telephone interview. METHODS: Charts of children
      diagnosed with "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome by a pediatric
      neuro-ophthalmologist between July 1993 and July 2013 were reviewed. Patients
      seen before 2012, or their parents, were contacted for follow-up information.
      RESULTS: A total of 48 patients (average age 8.1 years) diagnosed with "Alice in 
      Wonderland" syndrome or "Alice in Wonderland"-like syndrome were identified.
      Common visual symptoms were micropsia (69%), teleopsia (50%), macropsia (25%),
      metamorphopsia (15%), and pelopsia (10%). Magnetic resonance imaging and
      electroencephalography were unrevealing in 21 of 21 and 23 of 23 cases,
      respectively. The etiology was infection in 33% of patients and migraine and head
      trauma in 6% each. No associated conditions were found in 52%. Of the 15 patients
      with follow-up, 20% had a few more events of "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome or
      "Alice in Wonderland"-like syndrome, which eventually stopped after the initial
      diagnosis; 40% had no more events, and 40% were still having "Alice in
      Wonderland" syndrome or "Alice in Wonderland"-like syndrome symptoms at the time 
      of the interview, while four patients (27%) developed migraines and one patient
      (7%) seizures since the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome and
      "Alice in Wonderland"-like syndrome typically affect young children, and the most
      common visual complaints are micropsia and teleopsia. The most common associated 
      condition is infection, but half of these individuals have no obvious trigger.
      Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography are not helpful. The
      symptoms of "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome and "Alice in Wonderland"-like
      syndrome usually resolve, but in more than one third of the cases, they continue.
      One quarter of patients without a history of migraine may subsequently develop
      migraine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Headache Disorders-III beta
      includes a number of episodic syndromes associated with migraine. Those who treat
      pediatric headaches are aware of a number of other phenomena (such as the Alice
      in Wonderland syndrome) which are thought to occur as precursors of migraine.
      There is no available data on the course of these phenomena over the decades
      following childhood headache diagnosis. METHODS: Patients who were observed by
      one of the authors in 1983 were contacted by telephone in 1993, 2003, and 2013.
      Details were gathered regarding the presence and characteristics of ongoing
      headaches and about the presence of sleepwalking, motion sickness, and
      distortions of either time or space perceptions. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients
      were monitored in 1993, 2003, and 2013. Ongoing headaches were reported by 71%.
      Sleepwalking was only present in one patient in 2013. More than a third still
      complained of motion sickness, and more than one quarter still experienced
      distortions of time. Distortions of space were still reported by nearly 20%.
      Reporting any of these phenomena was not consistent over time, with some patients
      reporting distortions for the first time in adulthood. There was no clear
      correlation with migraine, and patients with tension-type headaches also reported
      the phenomena. CONCLUSIONS: Motion sickness and distortions of both space and
      time persist into the fifth decade for many patients initially observed with
      headaches in childhood. The correlation with migraine is less clear than
      previously thought.

AB  - My aim was to report for the first time (to my knowledge) the successful
      treatment of 3 patients with sporadic hemiplegic migraine by surgical cautery of 
      terminal branches of the external carotid artery under conscious sedation. Since 
      the operations (between 1 and 2 years) none of the patients have had further
      attacks of migraine or hemiplegia. This preliminary report suggests that for
      patients with sporadic hemiplegic migraine with a confirmed arterial component,
      surgical cautery of selected terminal branches of the external carotid artery may
      be effective treatment.

PG  - A7225
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is characterised by abnormal
      perception, such as metamorphopsia, macropsia, micropsia, teleopsia and pelopsia.
      Although brief and transient, these episodes of visual distortion may lead to
      great anxiety, especially in children. AIWS seems to be associated with specific 
      viral infections, epilepsy, migraine, and brain tumours. CASE DESCRIPTION: An
      8-year-old boy had episodes of seeing persons further away than they actually
      were (teleopsia). These perceptual distortions occurred when he was about to go
      to sleep. The episodes never exceeded 10 minutes. He was referred to a
      paediatrician and an ophthalmologist, who found no abnormalities. Serological
      tests showed a positive IgG for both Epstein-Barr and varicella zoster virus.
      CONCLUSION: The cause of AIWS is unclear. When occurring in the young patient,
      parents often become worried. In most cases no serious pathological cause is
      found. Usually, reassurance is sufficient. Therefore, general practitioners
      should be able to recognise the symptoms.

AB  - The Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a term applied to altered bizarre perceptions
      of size and shapes of a patient's body and illusions of changes in the forms,
      dimensions, and motions of objects that a patient with this syndrome encounters. 
      These metamorphopsias arise during complex partial seizures, migraine headaches, 
      infections, and intoxications. The illusions and hallucinations resemble the
      strange phenomena that Alice experienced in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in
      Wonderland. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, whose nom de plume was Lewis Carroll,
      experienced metamorphopsias. He described them in the story that he wrote for
      Alice Liddell and her two sisters after he spun a tale about a long and strange
      dream that the fictional Alice had on a warm summer day. The author of this
      chapter suggests that Dodgson suffered from migraine headaches and used these
      experiences to weave an amusing tale for Alice Liddell. The chapter also
      discusses the neurology of mercury poisoning affecting the behavior of Mad Hatter
      character. The author suggests that the ever-somnolent Dormouse suffered from
      excessive daytime sleepiness due to obstructive sleep apnea.

AB  - We present the case of a 53-year-old woman presenting several episodes of body
      image distortions, ground deformation illusions, and problems assessing distance 
      in the orthostatic position corresponding to the Alice in Wonderland syndrome. No
      symptoms were reported when sitting or lying down. She had uncontrolled
      hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and a history of head trauma. 
      Her condition had been diagnosed with left internal carotid artery dissection 2
      years earlier. Brain SPECT with 99mTc-ECD performed after i.v. injection of the
      radiotracer in supine and in standing positions showed hypoperfusion in the
      healthy contralateral frontoparietal operculum (Robin Hood syndrome),
      deteriorating when standing up.

TI  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome as aura of migraine.
PG  - 474-5
LID - 10.1080/13554794.2013.826676 [doi]
AB  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS), named for Lewis Carroll's titular character,
      is a disorder characterized by transient episodes of visual hallucinations and
      perceptual distortions, during which objects or body parts are perceived as
      altered in various ways (metamorphopsia), including enlargement (macropsia) or
      reduction (micropsia) in the perceived size of a form. Migraine aura is a
      transient neurological symptom that most commonly involves the visual fields and 
      occurs before the headache phase. Aura symptoms include the perception of
      flashing lights that begin in the center of vision and expand in jagged patterns 
      out into the periphery. Symptoms may be somatosensory, such as numbness and
      tingling in the lips or fingers. They may also involve a profound alteration of
      the perception of space and time (the "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome). In this
      article, we present a child had Alice in Wonderland syndrome as aura of migraine.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Migraine is common in pediatric neurology practice, while migraine
      variants are rare and pose diagnostic problems. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to
      establish the occurrence of migraine variants in pediatric neurology practice and
      among migraine, and to discuss their presentation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The
      files of 2509 newly diagnosed patients, aged 0-18 years, treated as in- and
      out-patients in the Neuropediatric Ward at the Plovdiv Medical University
      Hospital between 2002 and 2006 were examined retrospectively. Migraine forms were
      diagnosed according to ICHD-II. Benign paroxysmal torticolis and alternating
      hemiplegia of childhood were also accepted as migraine variants according to
      proposed diagnostic criteria in the appendix of ICHD-II. Some specific forms like
      acute confusional migraine (ACM), Alice in wonderland syndrome (AWS),
      ophthalmoplegic migraine were also diagnosed although not included as migraine
      variants in the ICHD-II classification. RESULTS: 111 patients met diagnostic
      criteria for migraine. Patients with migraine variants comprised 24.3% of
      migrainous cases. Basilar type migraine was the most common (6.3% of all
      migrainous patients), followed by benign paroxysmal vertigo (5.4%), hemiplegic
      migraine (3.6%), ACM (2.7%), benign paroxysmal torticolis (2.7%), typical aura
      without headache (1.8%), abdominal migraine (1.8%), AWS (0.9%), ophthalmoplegic
      migraine (0.9%) and cyclical vomiting (0.9%). Alternating hemiplegia of childhood
      and retinal migraine was not found. Some patients either presented or were
      classified as different migraine variants. CONCLUSION: Basilar type migraine was 
      the most common migraine variant. ACM and AWS should be regarded as distinct
      entities in the ICHD as migraine with complex aura. Benign paroxysmal torticollis
      also deserves its place as a migraine variant. Cases of ophthalmoplegic migraine 
      with spontaneous remission and no cranial nerve enhancement on MRI should be
      considered as migraine form. Analyzing migraine variants will contribute to
      better awareness and adequate diagnosis.

TI  - Alice in Wonderland Syndrome: somesthetic vs visual perceptual disturbance.
PG  - 1262-4
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31828970ae [doi]
AB  - In 1955, English psychiatrist John Todd (1914-1987) described Alice in Wonderland
      syndrome (AIWS) as self-experienced paroxysmal body image illusions involving
      distortions of the size, mass, or shape of the patient's own body or its position
      in space, often occurring with depersonalization and derealization.(1) Todd named
      AIWS for the perceptual disorder of altered body image experienced by the
      protagonist in the novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), written by
      Lewis Carroll(2) (the pseudonym of Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson
      [1832-1898]), possibly based in part on Dodgson's own migrainous experiences.(3) 
      In the story, Alice followed a talking white rabbit down a rabbit hole and then
      experienced several dramatic changes in her own body size and shape (e.g.,
      shrinking to 10 inches high, growing unnaturally large, and growing unnaturally
      tall but not any wider).(2) Although Todd's report was the most influential,
      Lippman(4) provided an earlier description in 1952. In Lippman's article, one of 
      the patients reported feeling short and wide as she walked, and referenced
      Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in regard to her body image illusions, referring
      to them as a "Tweedledum" or "Tweedledee" feeling.

      alice in wonderland syndrome.
PG  - 30-2
AB  - This case report describes a 13-year-old girl whose family requested a referral
      from the pediatrician for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in order to
      understand her recent onset of bizarre behavior. On assessment, she was found to 
      have episodes of complex audiovisual hallucinations and panic attacks with
      intervals of complete recovery associated with episodes of migraine headaches.
      The "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome," which is intimately associated with migraine 
      and epilepsy, as well as a number of other neurological conditions, could explain
      her episodic neurobehavioral disturbance.

TI  - Acute confusional migraine: is it a distinct form of migraine?
PG  - 250-6
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12094 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) -
      2004 recognises many migraine variants (different from migraine without aura and 
      migraine with typical aura), but acute confusional migraine (ACM) remains
      unclassified and most clinicians are not well acquainted with it. AIM: The aim of
      this study was to illustrate ACM in the neuropaediatric practice, to discuss its 
      place in the ICHD-II and to propose diagnostic criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 2509 files of newly diagnosed patients, aged 0-18 years, treated as in- 
      and outpatients in the Neuropaediatric Ward at the Plovdiv Medical University
      Hospital between 2002 and 2006 were screened retrospectively. Their diagnosis was
      based on detailed medical history, physical and neurological examination,
      additional functional, imaging and laboratory investigations. Migraine and
      migraine variants were diagnosed according to ICHD-II, but specific forms (e.g.
      ACM and Alice in wonderland syndrome) were also included. RESULTS: One hundred
      and eleven patients met the diagnostic criteria for migraine. Migraine variants
      comprised 24.3% of all migraine cases. In particular, ACM represented 11.1% of
      migraine variants or 2.7% of migraine and 0.12% of all paediatric neurological
      diseases. Here, we report three cases of ACM with analysis of the typical
      clinical and EEG features, review the literature and propose diagnostic criteria.
      CONCLUSION: ACM may present as either the only manifestation of a migraine attack
      or in the context of other migraine forms. ACM should have its own distinct place
      in the ICHD-II, may be as a subtype of migraine with complex aura.

TI  - Abdominal migraine reviewed from both central and peripheral aspects.
PG  - 75-7
LID - 10.5493/wjem.v2.i4.75 [doi]
AB  - Despite the 2%-5% prevalence of abdominal migraine (AM) during childhood, the
      precise mechanism remains unknown. In this review, we present recent studies on
      AM and speculate its mechanism from both peripheral and central nervous system
      aspects. Although the main symptoms of AM exist at the peripheral level, previous
      studies have reported possible dysfunction of central nervous system, including
      photophobia, phonophobia and abnormal visual evoked responses. Recently, a case
      has been reported with AM combined with "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome with
      visual and/or bodily distortions, which serves as another piece of evidence of
      central dysfunction. Another case reported an AM patient having peculiar
      stereotypical ecchymosis in the legs and buttocks associated with pain attack,
      which implied possible involvement of peripheral nervous system. Although further
      investigations and accumulation of AM cases are still needed, we believe that the
      schema hypothesized here is helpful to plan further experimental approach to
      clarify the mechanism of this peculiar disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the impairment of time perception in
      migraineurs. BACKGROUND: Headache is the most common pain syndrome in middle-aged
      adults, and migraine is highly prevalent and severely disabling. Although the
      mechanisms of and the therapies for migraines have long been explored, less is
      known about the functional impairments associated with them, especially the
      impairment in time perception, that is, the ability to estimate the passage of
      time. METHODS: In this study, we used a temporal reproduction task to assess the 
      estimation of the duration of visual stimulus in 27 migraine patients. The
      stimulus was delivered at different intervals over the milliseconds and seconds
      range. RESULTS: In the setting of an interstimulus interval for 1 second and an
      interstimulus interval for 5 seconds in the 600-millisecond-duration reproduction
      task, the migraineurs showed impairment in time perception, and in that they
      significantly overestimated the duration, as compared with the healthy subjects. 
      When compared with the healthy controls for the 3-second and 5-second duration
      reproduction task, migraineurs in the setting of an interstimulus interval for 1 
      second and an interstimulus interval for 5 seconds did not show impairment in
      time perception. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that not only is time
      perception impaired in migraineurs, but that this impairment is exhibited for
      durations in the milliseconds range, and not the seconds range.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Alice in Wonderland syndrome consists in a perceptual
      distortion of one's body size and shape. It is rarely encountered in adults,
      where it is mainly associated with migraine with aura and epilepsy. CASE REPORT: 
      A 37-year-old woman had had a migraine without aura since puberty. In the months 
      following a parturition, she experienced several epidodes of unusual auras
      preceding typical migrainous headache. The aura lasted about 30min and consisted 
      in the feeling of lengthening of the trunk and of the four limbs, associated with
      a sensation of well-being. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Epileptologic and
      experimental data suggest that the Alice in Wonderland syndrome is associated
      with a transient dysfunction of associative somatosensory areas in the parietal
      cortex.

AB  - We describe a 7-year-old boy with Alice in Wonderland syndrome associated with
      Lyme disease. He presented with metamorphopsia and auditory hallucinations in the
      absence of previous tick bites or other signs of Lyme disease. The boy never
      developed clinical seizures, and electroencephalograms during these spells
      indicated no epileptic activity. There was no history of migraine. Cranial
      magnetic resonance imaging produced normal results. Lyme serology tested positive
      in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. He was treated with intravenous
      ceftriaxone for 3 weeks, with complete resolution of signs. This case report is
      the first, to our knowledge, of neuroborreliosis presenting as Alice in
      Wonderland syndrome with complete resolution of findings after intravenous
      antibiotic treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a process characterized for complex
      disorders of the visual perception with multiple etiologies. AIM: To evaluate the
      clinical, electrophysiological, etiological characteristics and natural evolution
      in children with Alice in Wonderland syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have
      realized a retrospective study by what means of a review of 20 clinical histories
      of 18 year old minor patients diagnosed of Alice in Wonderland syndrome from
      January 1995 until February 2010. RESULTS: The average of age to the diagnosis
      was 9.5 +/- 3.8 years (range: 4-16 years). It appeared in an acute way in 85% and
      progressive in 15%. 90% had micropsias and/or macropsias, 85% distortion of the
      form of the objects, 80% displacement of objects, 45% disturbances of body image,
      45% acceleration of the time and 30% sensation of unreality. 95% of the children 
      had many episodes a day; these episodes lasted less than 3 minutes in 90%.
      Electroencephalogram was realized in all the patients, it was abnormal in 11
      cases, in one case was found and epileptic foci (left temporal) and in 10 cases
      was found posterior slow waves. The tests of neuroimagen were normal in all the
      patients. The visual evoked potentials were realized in 7 children; five of these
      children showed higher amplitude in evoked potentials and two of these children
      had normal. The infectious etiology was found in nine cases (five partners to
      Epstein-Barr virus), migraine in eight, toxins in two and epilepsy in one case.
      80% did not have recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a
      benign process with trend to spontaneous resolution and without recurrence in the
      majority of the occasions. The principal etiologies are migraine and Epstein-Barr
      virus infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare cluster of CNS symptoms
      characterized by visual distortions (i.e. metamorphopsias), body image
      distortions, time distortions, and deja experiences. Verbal auditory
      hallucinations (VAHs) are the most prevalent type of hallucination in adults with
      or without a history of psychiatric illness. Here, we report the case of a woman 
      with AIWS, long-lasting VAHs, and various additional perceptual and mood
      symptoms. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were used to assess symptoms, and
      functional MRI (fMRI) was employed to localize cerebral activity during
      self-reported VAHs. Treatment consisted of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) at a frequency of 1 Hz at T3P3, overlying Brodmann's area 40. 
      RESULTS: Activation during VAHs was observed bilaterally in the basal ganglia,
      the primary auditory cortex, the association auditory cortex, the temporal poles,
      and the anterior cingulated gyrus. The left and right inferior frontal gyri
      (Broca's area and its contralateral homologue) were involved, along with the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, synchronized activation was
      observed in the primary visual cortex (areas V1 and V2), and the bilateral dorsal
      visual cortex. The higher visual association cortex also showed significant, but 
      less prominent, activation. During the second week of rTMS treatment, not only
      the VAHs, but also the other sensory deceptions/distortions and mood symptoms
      showed complete remission. The patient remained free of any symptoms during a
      4-month follow-up phase. After 8 months, when many of the original symptoms had
      returned, a second treatment phase with rTMS was again followed by complete
      remission. CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates that VAHs and metamorphopsias in AIWS
      are associated with synchronized activation in both auditory and visual cortices.
      It also indicates that local rTMS treatment may have global therapeutic effects, 
      suggesting an effect on multiple brain regions in a distributed network. Although
      a placebo effect cannot be ruled out, this case warrants further investigation of
      the effects of rTMS treatment in AIWS.

TI  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome and upper airway obstruction in infectious
      mononucleosis.
PG  - 51-4
AB  - The Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a rare clinical feature characterised by
      perceptual disturbances including visual disturbances and distortion of the body 
      image. This uncommon--but often easy to recognise--syndrome, to which children
      seem particularly susceptible, can be defined in patients with Epstein Barr Virus
      (EBV) infection. This report describes a 10-year-old child with a mild upper
      airway obstruction and manifestations of the Alice in Wonderland syndrome
      resulting from an acute EBV infection. Because meningo-encephalitis was
      considered in the differential diagnosis, an MRI examination was performed under 
      midazolam sedation, leading to a severe life-threatening upper airway
      obstruction.

AB  - Migraine is a frequent primary headache disorder in children and adolescents.
      Most of the young sufferers of migraine describe typical migraine symptoms but
      sometimes rare forms of migraine variants and unusual types of migraine occur in 
      children and adolescents. These childhood periodic syndromes are common
      precursors of migraine. Phenotypes are alternating hemiplegia of childhood,
      benign paroxysmal torticollis, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood,
      alternating hemiplegia in childhood, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, cyclic
      vomiting syndrome, acute confusional migraine and abdominal migraine.

TI  - What associates Charles Bonnet syndrome with age-related macular degeneration?
PG  - 45-8
AB  - Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is a condition related to patients with visual loss
      due to age related macular degeneration or glaucoma that are having complex
      visual hallucinations. The CBS was first described by Swiss physician Charles
      Bonnet in 1760. Affected patients, who are otherwise mentally healthy people with
      significant visual loss, have vivid, complex recurrent visual hallucinations
      (VHs). One characteristic of these hallucinations is that they usually are
      "Lilliputian hallucinations" as patients experience micropsia (hallucinations in 
      which the characters or objects are distorted and much smaller than normal). The 
      prevalence of Charles Bonnet Syndrome has been reported to be between 10% and
      40%; a recent Australian study has found the prevalence to be 17.5%. The high
      incidence of non-reported CBS is thought to be as a result of patient's fear to
      report the symptoms as they could be labeled as mentally insane since those type 
      of visual hallucinations could be found in variety of psychiatric and
      neurological disorders such as drug or alcohol abuse (delirium tremens), Alice in
      Wonderland syndrome (AIWS), psychosis, schizophrenia, dementia, narcolepsy,
      epilepsy, Parkinson disease, brain tumors, migraine, as well as, in long term
      sleep deprivation. VHs can also be presented as the initial sign of the
      Epstein-Barr virus infection in infectious mononucleosis. Patients who suffer
      from CBS usually possess insight into the unreality of their visual experiences, 
      which are commonly pleasant but may sometimes cause distress. The hallucinations 
      consist of well-defined, organized, and clear images over which the subject has
      little control. It is believed that they represent release phenomena due to
      deafferentiation of the visual association areas of the cerebral cortex, leading 
      to a form of phantom vision. Cognitive defects, social isolation, and sensory
      deprivation have also been implicated in the etiology of this condition. This
      study was conducted on 350 patients diagnosed with Age-Related Macular
      Degeneration (AMD) and shows incidence of CBS in 13% of patients with AMD.
      Furthermore, we have found higher incidence of CBS in patients with massive loss 
      of vision in peripheral visual field which is not age related.

AB  - The different aspects of the global H1N1 influenza and its complications are
      currently of great interest. Neurological complications of the disease and its
      frequency are still unknown. We report a case of an 11-year-old girl who
      developed Alice in Wonderland syndrome associated with H1N1 influenza. This
      unique clinical syndrome was previously described in other diseases. The
      clinician's awareness of the existence of this syndrome in H1N1 influenza might
      save the child from undergoing extensive diagnostic procedures.

      children.
PG  - 893-6
LID - 10.1007/s00381-011-1400-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are some reports of so-called Alice-in-Wonderland syndrome mostly 
      concerning differential diagnosis, association with a variety of infectious
      diseases and even some case reports on functional imaging. Long-term data are
      rare. METHODS: Nine boys aged 6 to 11 years that had been diagnosed with
      Alice-in-Wonderland syndrome between 2003 and 2008 were contacted for a long-term
      follow-up study in summer, 2009, with a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. RESULTS: At 
      the time of the follow-up study, all children were in good general and mental
      health. Symptoms of Alice-in-Wonderland syndrome had ceased within weeks or
      months. In two patients, episodes of metamorphopsia returned after a symptom-free
      latency of 3 years and 1 year, respectively. Five children had a family history
      of migraine or epilepsy. In one case, the father was reported to have experienced
      similar symptoms when he was a child. CONCLUSION: Our follow-up study shows that 
      Alice-in-Wonderland is most likely a benign, self-terminating childhood
      condition, although occasional recurrences of symptoms are possible.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Literature complements medical literature in the academic and
      clinical development of neurologists. The present article explores the
      contributions of writers of fiction on neurology. SOURCES: Literary works of
      fiction with particular reference to neurology. DEVELOPMENT: A symbiosis between 
      writers of fiction and doctors has been well recognised. From Shakespeare to
      Cervantes by way of Dickens and Cela to writer - physicians such as Anton Chekhov
      or Antonio Lobo Antunes have contributed through their medically informed
      literature to the better understanding of neurology. Some writers like
      Dostoevsky, Machado de Assis and Margiad Evans have written about their own
      experiences with disease thus bringing new insights to medicine. Furthermore,
      some neurological disorders have been largely based on literary descriptions. For
      instance, Dostoevsky's epilepsy has been retrospectively analysed by famous
      neurologists including Freud, Alajouanine or Gastaut, whilst his writings and
      biography have prompted others like Waxman and Geschwind to describe typical
      behavioural changes in temporal lobe epilepsy, finding their source of
      inspiration in Dostoevsky. Likewise, Cirignotta et al have named an unusual type 
      of seizure after the Russian novelist. Inspired by Lewis Carroll, Todd introduced
      the term Alice in Wonderland Syndrome to refer to visual distortions generally
      associated with migraine. CONCLUSIONS: Writers of fiction offer a humanised
      perception of disease by contributing new insights into the clinical history,
      informing about the subjective experience of the illness and helping to eradicate
      the stigma associated to neurological disorders.

      brief, transient episodes of visual distortions (metamorphopsia) and can occur in
      conjunction with certain viral infections. We used functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging to examine visual processing in a 12-year-old boy with viral-onset Alice 
      in Wonderland syndrome during an episode of micropsia (reduction in the perceived
      size of a form). METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in 
      response to a passive viewing task (reversing checkerboard) and an active viewing
      task (line-length decisions in the context of the Ponzo illusion). RESULTS: In
      both tasks, the child with Alice in Wonderland syndrome showed reduced activation
      in primary and extrastriate visual cortical regions but increased activation in
      parietal lobe cortical regions as compared with a matched control participant.
      CONCLUSIONS: The active experience of micropsia in viral-onset Alice in
      Wonderland syndrome reflects aberrant activity in primary and extrastriate visual
      cortical regions as well as parietal cortices. The disparate patterns of activity
      in these regions are discussed in detail.

AB  - Various visual and sensory phenomena have been described in migraine with aura.
      Among those, the 'Alice in Wonderland' syndrome is defined as a distortion of the
      body image with the patient being aware of its unreal nature. Here, the case of a
      17-year-old girl with migraine without aura who developed an 'Alice in
      Wonderland' syndrome repeatedly on topiramate treatment was presented and
      potential pathophysiological concepts were discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal migraine is a commonly described migraine variant in
      children and young adults, but associations with Alice in Wonderland syndrome and
      lilliputian hallucinations are exceptional. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20 years-old
      male experienced frequent and prolonged attacks of abdominal colic associated
      with autonomic manifestations started at the age of ten. At the age of 17, he
      additionally described prolonged attacks (>or= 7 days) of distortions of shape,
      size or position of objects or subjects. He said "Quite suddenly, objects appear 
      small and distant (teliopsia) or large and close (peliopsia). I feel as I am
      getting shorter and smaller "shrinking" and also the size of persons are not
      longer than my index finger (a lilliputian proportion). Sometimes I see the blind
      in the window or the television getting up and down, or my leg or arm is
      swinging. I may hear the voices of people quite loud and close or faint and far. 
      Occasionally, I experience attacks of migrainous headache associated with eye
      redness, flashes of lights and a feeling of giddiness. I am always conscious to
      the intangible changes in myself and my environment". There is a strong family
      history of common migraine. Clinical examination, brain-MRI and EEG were normal. 
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation and evoked potentials revealed enhanced
      cortical excitability in multiple brain regions. Treatment with valproate
      resulted in marked improvement of all clinical and neurophysiological
      abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the two migraine variants
      (abdominal migraine and Alice in Wonderland Syndrome) might have clinical,
      pathophysiological and management implications. I think this is the first
      description in the literature.

TI  - [Alice in Wonderland syndrome as persistent aura of migraine and migraine disease
      starting].
PG  - 520-2
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Migraine with aura in children is often described, but
      communications of typical aura without headache are rare, and persistent aura and
      Alice in Wonderland syndrome are exceptional. CASE REPORT: A 8 years-old girl who
      experiences during a month one to three brief episodes a day during which she
      relates: 'I saw things as little and remote, sometimes they moved; one day I saw 
      my sister's books turning bigger, and another day my father getting little as a
      doll; sometimes my doll's leg swinged, or the blind in the window got up and
      down'. Later these attacks spaced out to one each to days for another two weeks. 
      With no previous episodes of headache, these start two days after the visual
      distortions disappeared, with clinical features of migraine without aura. There
      were antecedents of migraine in maternal line, and no previous trauma, epilepsy, 
      drug ingestion or psychiatric disorders. Clinical examination, cranial RMI, and
      EEG were normal. CONCLUSION: Although Alice in Wonderland syndrome was described 
      as a migraine aura, it is usually brief, and it is exceptional that it lasts
      longer than a week. We think this is the first description in a pediatric
      patient.

TI  - Kaethe Kollwitz (1867-1945): the artist who may have suffered from Alice in
      Wonderland Syndrome.
PG  - 106-10
LID - 10.1258/jmb.2008.008042 [doi]
AB  - Kaethe Kollwitz was a 20th century German artist who grew to fame for her
      socio-political impressions of Germany during World Wars I and II. In her diary, 
      Kollwitz self-described symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome during her
      childhood. She complained of episodes where objects appeared to grow larger or
      smaller and perceptual distortions where she felt she was diminishing in size.
      This may explain why Kollwitz's artistic style appeared to shift from naturalism 
      to expressionism, and why her artistic subjects are often shaped with large hands
      and faces. The distortion present in her visual art may have less to do with a
      deliberate emphasis of the artist's feelings and more to do with her perceptual
      experience.

TI  - [Visual perception deficits of cortical origin].
PG  - 976-82
AB  - This work comprises of a literature review on visual perception distortions that 
      have their origin in structural or functional irregularities of the brain,
      resulting in the cortex malfunction. The main area that we pay attention to is
      the brain cortex, but we should not forget, that diseases destructive to the
      lower brain structures also inevitably lead to secondary dysfunction of the
      cortex, and thus they have also been included in this paper. Cerebral vision
      disorders are a small percentage of caseload in either neurology or ophthalmology
      practice, yet they certainly are interesting for the cognitive scientists, as
      they open a window into the complex mechanisms of the cerebral clockwork. We are 
      presenting examples of disorders, many of which engage the creative cooperation
      between specialists from different fields of neuroscience. Three kinds of
      disorders are presented: vision loss, agnosias and hallucinations. Among others
      there is some information on cortical blindness, blindsight, Anton's syndrome,
      hysterical blindness, apperceptive and associative agnosia, prosopagnosia, pure
      alexia, achromatopsia, Bonnet syndrome, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, peduncular 
      halucinosis etc.

TI  - Reversible palinopsia and the Alice in Wonderland syndrome associated with
      topiramate use in migraineurs.
PG  - 815-8
AB  - Two patients are reported who developed palinopsia while taking topiramate for
      migraine prevention which resolved or decreased in frequency or duration on lower
      doses, but recurred or increased in frequency or duration on higher doses. Both
      patients had complete resolution of palinopsia when topiramate was discontinued. 
      A third patient is described who developed the "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome
      about 1 week after starting topiramate for migraine prevention with complete
      resolution of symptoms about 1 month after stopping. Topiramate use may cause
      palinopsia and may be associated with the Alice in Wonderland syndrome through an
      unknown mechanism.

TI  - [Migrainous complex hallucinations in 10-year old patient--a case report and
      review].
PG  - 201-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Considering a prevalence of three to ten percent migraine in children
      is not a rare disease. Visual auras as a characteristic of classical migraine are
      often described in literature. However, most of these are primary hallucinations,
      whilst descriptions of complex hallucinations are barely to find. As far as we
      know this work describes the youngest age, at which complex hallucinations
      occurred in migraine attacks. Reviewing the existing literature possible
      pathophysiologic mechanisms and differential diagnosis are discussed. METHODS: We
      introduce a case-report of a 10-year old-patient who reports a complex visual
      hallucination during a migraine attack. Symptoms, history and diagnostic measures
      are described. In differential diagnosis to a migrainous aura the
      "Alice-in-Wonderland-syndrome", "Lilliputian hallucinations", the basilar
      migraine and epilepsy are discussed. RESULTS: For complex hallucinations an
      analogical pathomechanism to primary hallucinations in migraine can be assumed.
      The great variety of the migrainous aura is pointed out.

TI  - [Obligatory and facultative symptoms of the Alice in wonderland syndrome].
PG  - 287-93
AB  - The Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS), as described by Todd in 1955, denotes a 
      variety of self-experienced paroxysmal body schema disturbances (obligatory core 
      symptoms of the AIWS) which may co-occur with depersonalization, derealization,
      visual illusions and disorders of the time perception (facultative symptoms of
      the AIWS). The name comes, of course, from Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel "Alice's
      Adventures in Wonderland", which is believed to have been inspired by Carroll's
      own migraine experiences documented as early as 1856. Recent studies of the AIWS 
      occurring as somesthetic migraine aura indicated that the body schema disturbance
      of macrosomatognosia most frequently affects the head and upper extremities,
      paralleling the extension of their representation in the human brain. As a
      misapprehension commonly encountered in the medical literature, it has been
      suggested to define the AIWS by the presence of visual rather than somesthetic
      perceptual disturbances, e.g. metamorphopsia and/or visual hallucinations, but
      this change and broadening of Todd's definition of the AIWS turns it to a both
      scientifically and clinically useless concept.

TI  - Neurological complications of acute and persistent Epstein-Barr virus infection
      in paediatric patients.
PG  - 253-63
AB  - Neurological complications of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been reported almost 
      exclusively in the course of acute primary infections. The role of EBV in
      paediatric neurological disease was investigated prospectively over a 2-year
      period, searching for acute primary, chronic, and reactivated EBV infections.
      Active EBV infections were diagnosed in 10/48 patients, including two with acute 
      primary EBV infections (cranial neuritis and cerebellitis), one with chronic
      active infection (T/NK cell lymphoma with cranial neuritis), and seven with
      reactivated infections. Among these seven patients, three showed "Alice in
      Wonderland" syndrome, one facial nerve palsy, one progressive macrocephaly, and
      two prolonged encephalitic illness. The prognosis was good except for the patient
      with lethal T/NK cell lymphoma and the two girls with encephalitic illness.
      Despite steroid treatment, these girls suffered prolonged cognitive impairment
      and epileptic seizures. Both developed left-sided hippocampal atrophy, and one of
      them hippocampal sclerosis. Like primary infections, reactivated EBV infections
      cause neurological complications in a considerable number of paediatric patients,
      lead to serious long-term complications, and may contribute to the pathogenesis
      of hippocampal lesions.

      following Epstein-Barr virus infection].
PG  - 348-52
AB  - Characteristic pathologic changes of cranial computed tomography (CT) and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have never been reported in "Alice in
      Wonderland" syndrome (AIWS) caused by Epstein-Barr (EB) virus infection. We
      present here a 10-year-old girl with AIWS with an abnormal MR finding. During the
      course of serologically confirmed EB virus encephalopathy, she had distortion of 
      the body image, visual hallucinations and depersonalization characteristic of
      AIWS. MRI demonstrated transient T2 prolongation and swelling of the cerebral
      cortex, especially at the bilateral temporal lobes, bilateral cingulate gyrus,
      right upper frontal gyrus, bilateral caudate nucleus, and bilateral putamen,
      whereas CT showed no abnormalities. Transient MRI lesions were occasionally
      reported in patients with EB virus encephalopathy/encephalitis who presented
      visual illusions and psychotic reactions, although the diagnosis of AIWS was not 
      described. We consider that any patient with symptoms of AIWS should have MRI
      because the abnormal MRI findings may disappear in a short period.

PG  - 601-2
AB  - The Alice in Wonderland syndrome refers to distortions in body image and in the
      apparent sizes, shapes, and spatial relations of objects seen. The syndrome is
      usually associated with migraine headaches and has also been reported in several 
      viral infections. We report a 6-year-old boy who presented to the emergency
      department complaining of several episodes in which the ceiling, the objects and 
      the people around him seemed very small and far away. The child presented no
      alteration in the level of consciousness. The episodes provoked great fear in the
      child. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities except pharyngoamygdalitis.
      Serologic studies (IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen) confirmed Epstein-Barr
      virus infection. The child's symptoms resolved spontaneously within 48 hours and 
      he continued to be asymptomatic after a 4 -month follow-up. We consider that all 
      children presenting a clinical picture consistent with the Alice in Wonderland
      syndrome should undergo serological testing for Epstein Barr virus infection.
      Diagnosis would enable physicians to reassure the family of the temporary and
      benign nature of this alarming condition.

AB  - The present paper describes a case of abuse of toluene-based solvent in which
      features of both 'Alice in Wonderland' (AIW) syndrome with deja vu , and
      delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS), were exhibited. Toluene-induced
      brain dysfunction was the basis of the weak ties between percepts and sensory
      information, which in turn led to the misperceptions. Once misperceptions fed
      back into the cycle comprised of misperceptions, false beliefs and erroneous
      expectations, DMS were induced. AIW syndrome with deja vu is a precursor and
      forms the basis of DMS.

PG  - 140-6
AB  - Fourteen children with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encephalitis admitted to our
      pediatric department during the period 1988 to 1998 were collected and reviewed
      to characterize the clinical, laboratory and neuroradiological findings. There
      were 7 boys and 7 girls. The age of onset ranged from 10 months to 14 years.
      Among them, 5 patients belonged to Alice in Wonderland syndrome, 5 were diagnosed
      as acute viral encephalitis, 1 presented with acute meningoencephalitis followed 
      by cerebellitis, the remaining 3 cases attributed to acute disseminated
      encephalomyelitis. The main symptoms were fever (43%), seizure (36%), bizarre
      behavior (31%), headache (21%) and metamorphopsia (36%). The presenting signs
      included altered consciousness (50%), meningeal sign (14%), bulbar sign (14%),
      cerebellar sign (7%), and cranial nerve palsy (7%). Classic findings of
      infectious mononucleosis were obscure. The laboratory data showed the existence
      of atypical lymphocyte in only one case but positive serology for EBV infection
      in all patients. Pleocytosis was found in 3 (30%) of 10 patients examined. Eight 
      (67%) of 12 patients had nonspecific electroencephalographic changes in the acute
      stage. Computed tomography (CT) scans were abnormal in 2 (40%) of 5 patients
      tested; while magnetic resonance image (MRI) disclosed lesions in 5 (56%) of 9
      patients, with abnormal signals in various parts of the brain. Single photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scan showed abnormal perfusion lesions
      in 3 (75%) of 4 patients studied. The results demonstrate the diversity of
      neurological manifestations of EBV encephalitis. EBV should be considered in any 
      acute neurological illness of uncertain etiology in the pediatric population.
      While MRI remains the image of choice in EBV encephalitis, SPECT detects the
      abnormal perfusion more precisely in a substantial number of patients.

TI  - [The Alice in Wonderland syndrome].
PG  - 397-401
AB  - The "Alice in Wonderland syndrome includes an array of symptoms involving altered
      perception of shape (meta-morphopsia) of objects or persons who appear to be
      smaller (micropsia) or larger (macropsia) than normal, of impaired sense of
      passage of time, of zooming of the environment. This unusual neurological picture
      which can be confused with psychosis or drug intoxication has been found to
      accompany cerebral lesions mainly temporo-occipital or parietal-occipital
      temporal epilepsy and migraine. Todd gave the syndrome its literary name in his
      report in 1955, describing a singular group of symptoms closely associated with
      migraine and epilepsy. However the first description of the condition was made by
      Lippman in 1952. This syndrome is so called because of the resemblance of its
      symptoms to the fluctuations in size and shape that plague the main character in 
      Lewis Carrol's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland. Cases of "Alice in Wonderland"
      syndrome have been described associated with infectious mononucleosis. In each
      clinical case, the classical infectious mononucleosis symptoms and diagnosis
      followed the onset of visual aberration. Nuclear medicine techniques are able to 
      demonstrate changes in cerebral perfusion and may be used to detect abnormal
      cerebral areas in patients with AIWS.

TI  - Abnormal visual evoked potentials in children with "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome
      due to infectious mononucleosis.
PG  - 732-5
AB  - Visual illusions characterized by distortion of form, size, reciprocal position
      of objects, movement, or color, labeled as "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome, were
      discussed in children with infectious mononucleosis, as well as in other clinical
      conditions, such as migraine, epilepsy, use of certain hallucinogenic drugs, etc.
      The purpose of our study was to investigate for the first time visual evoked
      potential results in children with "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome associated with
      infectious mononucleosis. Five children with "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome
      associated with infectious mononucleosis underwent visual evoked potential
      studies during and after their clinical symptoms. Visual evoked potential results
      during the disease demonstrated statistically significant high amplitudes of
      P100-N145 in all children compared to the control group. A few weeks later,
      repeated studies after the resolution of the complaints were normal. Since the
      same findings can be observed in patients with migraine, we postulate that a
      common pathophysiologic underlying abnormality, which can cause transient focal
      decreased cerebral perfusion, could be involved in the disease process of these
      two conditions.

TI  - 'Alice in Wonderland' syndrome and Lilliputian hallucinations in a patient with a
      substance-related disorder.
PG  - 47-9
AB  - The present paper describes a patient who exhibited 'Alice in Wonderland' (AIW)
      syndrome as well as Lilliputian hallucinations. The patient regularly consumed a 
      cough syrup that contained dihydrocodein phosphate and dl-methylephedrine
      hydrochloride over 3 years. At the age of 46, he developed AIW syndrome. The
      patient ingested a large dose of triazolam and exhibited delirium. Even after the
      disappearance of symptoms associated with AIW syndrome and delirium, the patient 
      continued to experience Lilliputian hallucinations. We believe that these
      hallucinations were caused by some of the components of the cough syrup.

AB  - Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is characterized by visual hallucinations and
      bizarre perceptual distortions. Technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine
      tomography (SPECT) brain scans were performed in four patients during the acute
      stage of AIWS. Two patients were demonstrated to have Epstein-Barr virus
      infections. One had abnormal (EEG) findings. The visual-evoked potential, cranial
      CT, and MRI findings were negative. The decreased cerebral perfusion areas in all
      patients were near the visual tract and visual cortex. All involved some regions 
      of the temporal lobe. In most patients with AIWS, the EEG, CT, and MRI are unable
      to determine the precise pathologic areas. However, a SPECT brain scan may
      demonstrate abnormal perfusion areas and explain the clinical presentations.

AB  - A 54-year-old Japanese businessman who was found to exhibit the 'Alice in
      Wonderland' syndrome and went on to develop a depressive disorder is described.
      Lengthening and shortening of time experience continued intermittently for about 
      3 months, and metamorphopsia, distortion of body image, and the quick-motion
      phenomenon (alteration in time sense) persisted for almost 2 days without
      interruption. There were no abnormal physical findings. The authors review
      studies on 'Alice in Wonderland' syndrome and suggest that depressive illness may
      be a causal factor.

AB  - A 15-year-old male was referred for evaluation of dizziness for the past 2
      months. He complained of visual distortion and feeling of disorientation, was a
      poor student, and denied recreational drug use. His symptoms were consistent with
      the so-called "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome associated with Epstein-Barr virus
      infection. This case is an illustration of neurologic symptoms appearing without 
      the features of infectious mononucleosis.

PG  - 316
AB  - We present a patient with serologically confirmed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
      infection who had illusions of size, shape, and colour of objects but none of the
      typical symptoms and signs peculiar to infectious mononucleosis (IM) except sore 
      throat which developed 2 weeks after the initial visual disturbances. The bizarre
      feelings about the images of body and objects are called the 'Alice in Wonderland
      syndrome' due to the similarity with Alice's dreams. The same symptomatology
      including visual metamorphosia is defined in patients with migraine, epilepsy,
      intoxication due to hallucinogenic drugs, schizophrenia, hyperpyrexia, and
      cerebral lesions. Alice in Wonderland syndrome has also been reported in the
      course of IM.

PG  - 89-95
AB  - Ten patients, aged from 3 to 10 years, who had either had attacks of perception
      errors of body schema and objects or had visual hallucination were enrolled from 
      1987 to 1990. Seven were boys and three, girls. The metamorphopsia or visual
      hallucination that has been named the "Alice in Wonderland syndrome" (AIWS) were 
      the leading presentations. All the patients had preceding episodes of upper
      respiratory tract infection (URI) from two days to four weeks previously except
      for one who had had chickenpox within the immediate three days of being seen.
      Among these patients, six had received serological studies for Epstein-Barr (EB) 
      virus infection. Two patients were indeed victims of acute EB virus infection as 
      documented by positive IgM antibody against EB virus capsid antigen, the other
      three patients were highly suspected of having had recent EB virus infection as
      suggested by positive Heterophil antibody test and high IgG antibody titer
      against EB virus capsid antigen (1:320X). The duration of perception disorder
      ranged from four days to three months. All cases recovered completely, without
      sequelae. It is emphasized that any young children who present as acute episodes 
      of AIWS should undergo examination for EB virus infection. The neurological
      outcome of AIWS seems to be good.

TI  - Literary neurologic syndromes. Alice in Wonderland.
PG  - 649-51
AB  - Many neurologic syndromes are named for literary characters. For example, the
      "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome of altered body perceptions, usually caused by
      migrainous ischemia, is so called because of the resemblance of its symptoms to
      the fluctuations in size and shape that plague the main character in Lewis
      Carroll's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland. The medical symptoms of distorted body 
      images match the literary description so precisely that illustrations from the
      original book depict them very accurately. Because Lewis Carroll suffered from
      classic migraine headaches, scholars have speculated that he may have experienced
      this syndrome himself.

TI  - The Alice in Wonderland syndrome in juvenile migraine.
PG  - 517-9
AB  - Two children are reported who had recurrent attacks of impairment of time sense, 
      body image, and visual analysis of the environment. These occurred with a clear
      state of consciousness and in the absence of any evidence of an encephalitic
      process, seizures, drug ingestion, or psychiatric illness. Both children had
      recurrent headaches; one was clearly migrainous. There was a family history of
      migraine in both cases. These children represent examples of the Alice in
      Wonderland syndrome in juvenile migraine.

TI  - "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome as a presenting symptom of infectious
      mononucleosis in children: a description of three affected young people.
PG  - 143-6
AB  - Three cases of "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome (metamorphopsia) are presented and 
      described as a presenting symptom of infectious mononucleosis in a preadolescent 
      male and in two late teenage females. In each instance, the classical infectious 
      mononucleosis symptoms and diagnosis followed the onset of visual aberration.
      Thorough physical and blood examination of patients who present with such a
      syndrome must be undertaken before these symptoms are ascribed to psychiatric
      abnormalities. It is emphasized that infectious mononucleosis is a diffuse
      disorder, often associated with encephalopathies, which may include visual
      imbalance symptoms.
